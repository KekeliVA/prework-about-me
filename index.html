      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am Kekeli Afantchao, a recent college graduate from the 
        University of Hartford. I earned a B.S. in Audio Engineering Technology
      and an A.S. in Electrical Engineering Technology. I am currently a 
      contractor at Kaman. My plans now are to complete UConn School of
      Engineering's Coding Bootcamp, find a job in software development, 
      complete the CompTIA Security+ certification, and
      earn a masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Philadelphia, PA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are ultimate frisbee, videogames, watching
      Twitch streams, and watching sports.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to become a software developer at a company who's 
        culture and belief system is aligned with my own values.

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Farmington, CT.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have had a few assembly/maintenance jobs since starting my 
      degrees and I found that it's not stimulating enough for me. Since 
      high school I have wanted to learn how to code, so this is a long time 
      coming. Programming is so rewarding and more technically involved technically
      jobs I've had in the past, so that's why I'm pursuing it.
